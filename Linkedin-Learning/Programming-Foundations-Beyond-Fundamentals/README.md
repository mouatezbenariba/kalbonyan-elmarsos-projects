## 💻 [Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-beyond-the-fundamentals)
### Course details
- Gain the core knowledge to begin programming in any language. In this course, instructor Annyce Davis uses Python to explore the core concepts and structure of programming languages and helps you grasp what’s going on under the hood. After going over basic statements and expressions in Python, Annyce explores strings, variables, and conditional code—which are common topics in all programming languages. She also shows how to work with different kinds of data and troubleshoot a variety of errors. Along the way, she compares how code is written in several different languages and provides guidance on the criteria to use when choosing a programming language. Upon wrapping up this course, you’ll have the knowledge you need to continue your coding journey in whichever language piques your interest.

## 📝 Course Notes

### 1. Collections
#### A. Understanding collections
##### 🔴 What does a Collection mean?
  - Collection : Grouping multiple items together and storing them with a single name, called a variable.
##### 🔴 Pros of Collections
  - Uses your code struvture to indicate that multiple pieces of data are related.
  - Avoids creating a potentially huge nulber of variables to track within our code.
  - Offers simplified syntax.
<br>

#### B. Creating simple collections
##### 🟣 What does a List mean?
  - List: Simple collection that groups  pieces of data together in a certain order and assigns the collection a name.
<br>

#### C. Creating more complex collections
##### 🟣 What does a Dictionary mean?
  - Dictionary: Dictionary data lets you store related information, but with a label for each item, providing more information and giving more flexibility.

### 2. Iteration
#### A. Introduction to iteration
##### 🔴 What does an Iteration mean?
  - Iteration : Reapeats the same procedure multiple times until it reaches a specified endpoint.
##### 🔴 What does a loop mean?
  - Loop: code that iterates, moving from beginnig to end of the process, then starting over.
##### 🔴 In a loop we must:
  - Specify the data that been iterated through.
  - Indicate when the loop should stop.
  - waht should happen tp data during each iteration.
##### 🔴 Infinite Loop
Infinite loop: bug that can occur when the ending condition is omitted or specified incorrectly.
<br>
<br>
#### B. Iterating through collections
##### 🟣 for lorem in abcd:
- for statement : specifies a variable name that we can use in each iteration of the loop to reference the current value.
- in : indicates that what follows is the set of values that we want to iterate through 
- Note that Indented statements are executed in each iteration.
<br>

#### C. Iterating to a custom endpoint
##### 🟢 While (python)
- while : creates a loop in python.

### 3. Using External Code
#### A. Comparing types of external code
##### 🔴 Module, Package or Library, framework:
  - Module: pyhton file that  contains code, like variables or functions.
  - Package or Library : Using multiple modules together so they are distributed and used in a group. 
  - Framework: when a set of code is not just used togrther but used in a specific way. When you use a framework, you let the external code set the basic structure and flow of your program and you customize it for your use case.
##### 🔴 Library vs framework (daily life example)
  - Using a library is similar to buying a cake mix. The basic ingredients are measured and combined for you, saving you some time but you still get to pick the shape of the pan, the type of frosting and any filling or decoration you want to use. 
  - Using a framework is like buying a birthday cake from a bakery. You may be able to select among a few flavors and you can specify the basic decoration style but the bakery will probably have a standard size and shape for all cakes.

### 4. Working with Strings
#### A. Creating regular expressions
##### 🔴 what is a Regular Expression?
  - Regular Expression (Regex): allows you to create a description of a pattern that you want to match to, and it is made of Letters, Numbers and Special characters.
  - (re) module contains methods for creating and working with regular expressions. for example :
    - re.search : takes two arguments the re and the string to compare against it. 
##### 🔴 The meaning of some charachters in Regex
  - (+) : use the plus sign to indicate one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern. 
  - (*) : Asterisk indicates zero or more and question mark indicates zero or one.
  - . : a dot indicates any character 
  - / : Back slashes mark many patterns in a regular expression.
     ex: 
      - \d : indicates a digit. 
      - \w : indicates a word character like a letter. 
  - r'':  I start with the letter R. This indicates that the string that follows may include back slashes that the compiler should ignore (check exercise 04_03.py (r'\d{5}').   
  - /hello/ : you can indicate specific text you're looking for by enclosing it in slashes.
