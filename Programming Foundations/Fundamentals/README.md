### 1. Programming Basics
#### What is programming ?
- Programming is how we communicate with the digital world. It's characterized by having instructions that are specific and sequential.
- In other words, programming is the process of converting ideas into instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

#### Bug vs Crash
- A bug is when something unexpected happens, whereas a crash is when your program stops early or freezes.

#### Plain text vs Rich text
- Diffrence between plain text and rich text: A plain text file is a document that contains no formatting, images, colors or other types of markup. It also includes single line breaks and spacing. A rich text file is the default format of popular word-processors like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages and Notes, a Google Doc, and even HTML emails (source : Internet).

### 2. Programming Syntax
#### Why we use IDEs instead of simple text editors ?
- You can write entire programs in simple text editors, but in practice few programmers do. They use enhanced text editors called integrated development environments, or IDEs.

#### What is syntax highlighting ?
- Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms. (source : Wikipedia)

#### What are statements ?
- Statements are the individual actions that you want your program to take.

#### What are operators ?
- Operators are symbols that tell the computer to perform an action with some input.

#### Syntax vs Runtime vs Semantic (Troublesshooting issues) ?
- Syntax : Language rules broken.
- Runtime : Unable to execute.
- Semantic: Unexpected output.
