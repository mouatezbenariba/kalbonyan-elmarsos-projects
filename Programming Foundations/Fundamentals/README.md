## 📝 Course Notes

### 1. Programming Basics
#### What is programming ?
- Programming is how we communicate with the digital world. It's characterized by having instructions that are specific and sequential.
- In other words, programming is the process of converting ideas into instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

#### Bug vs Crash
- A bug is when something unexpected happens, whereas a crash is when your program stops early or freezes.

#### Plain text vs Rich text
- Diffrence between plain text and rich text: A plain text file is a document that contains no formatting, images, colors or other types of markup. It also includes single line breaks and spacing. A rich text file is the default format of popular word-processors like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages and Notes, a Google Doc, and even HTML emails (source : Internet).

### 2. Programming Syntax
#### Why we use IDEs instead of simple text editors ?
- You can write entire programs in simple text editors, but in practice few programmers do. They use enhanced text editors called integrated development environments, or IDEs.
